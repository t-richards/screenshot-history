# Screenshot History

Windows application that displays your clipboard's most recent image, as well as
the previous one.

## Use case

I needed a quick-reference multiple-image clipboard viewer because...

  - I needed to take exactly two screenshots of various things
  - I only needed the screenshots to be present on the screen temporarily for reference purposes
  - I didn't want to save any images to disk

## _Another_ clipboard viewer application?

I tried the other applications you're thinking of, and they...

  - Displayed only a single image
  - Displayed multiple images as tiny thumbnails
  - Required clicking a "refresh" button to display clipboard contents
  - Polled the clipboard for changes (ugh)
  - Looked like some jank trialware with entirely too many worthless features
